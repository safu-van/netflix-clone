# Netflix Clone Project

Welcome to the repository! This project is a Netflix-inspired web application that I built using **ReactJS** as the frontend framework. The primary goal of this project was to enhance my ReactJS skills and learn how to fetch data from a public API, specifically **The Movie Database (TMDB)** API, to display movies dynamically.

## Key Technologies Used:
- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TMDB API**: Used to fetch real-time data on movies and display them within the app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling of the application.

## Why I Built This Project:
I developed this Netflix Clone to:
- Improve my ReactJS development skills by building a real-world, dynamic application.
- Learn how to integrate third-party APIs (TMDB) for fetching and displaying data.
- Practice responsive design techniques using **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Movie Listings**: Fetch and display movies, TV shows, and genres from the TMDB API.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed for both desktop and mobile users using Tailwind CSS.
- **API Integration**: Efficiently fetched and managed movie data from TMDBâ€™s public API.
